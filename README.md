# RecPlay

## before reading

This is an **unfinished** project, the original framework is under [main branch](https://github.com/Furyton/Recommender-Baseline-Model)

I found there is a lot of place that needs improvement in that branch. And I have modified quite a lot from there.

## TODO

- refactor some confusing code
- add a general way to do model ensembling
- add some easy-to-use log functions for debugging
- redesign the model part
- make the pipeline part more intuitive

## intro

a highly flexible framework for recommender system based on pytorch.

## support model

- bert4rec
- caser
- gru4rec
- pop

## interesting features

- you can add your own pipeline very easily.
- well designed log system
- easy to modify on your interest
