# Recommender-Baseline-Model
common used Recommend System Baseline Model, including the traditional statistical model, and the Neural Network Model. Focus on the SRS (Sequential Recommend System).

## info

### Neural Network

The Neural Network Model includes Bert4Rec and SAS4Rec

the majority of the code in bert4rec is from [Jaywonchung](https://github.com/jaywonchung/BERT4Rec-VAE-Pytorch) , and [pmixer](https://github.com/pmixer/SASRec.pytorch) for SAS4rec

both models are implemented in pytorch



I combine these two models into the same framework, which means you can choose the model you'd like to use by typing in the parameter.
